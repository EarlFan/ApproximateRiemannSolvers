# Approximate Riemann Solvers
This repo is my personal collection of Riemann solvers using MUSCL and WENO schemes written as short Matlab. They are now publicly available as I have moved to do research in another field of CFD. Any feed back on these snipets is always welcome. All references can be found as comments inside the scripts. Happy coding!
